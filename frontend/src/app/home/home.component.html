  <h1>Why PCPlanner?</h1>
  <p>The #1 consideration when building a personal computer is how much it will cost. That's why I built PCPlanner. The goal of this website is to streamline the process of spending countless hours of research to find the best PC for your budget. Instead, simply specify how much you're willing to spend, and PCPlanner does the rest!</p>
  <p>PCPlanner uses an algorithm to navigate through a database of over 3,000 components. Using the power of ChatGPT's 4o model, you'll also be given each computer's tradeoffs and plans for future proofing. </p>
